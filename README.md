# Word Counter
As the title suggests, this is a simple word-counting tool that allows users to input text and instantly view the total word count. It also includes an optional feature to validate the text against a specified word-count requirement, aimed at helping students meet assignment guidelines.

This program was written entirely in Python and is CLI-based.

As of right now, I don't necessarily plan on adding more to this, as this program was really just meant for me to practice writing in Python for any possible career endeavors in the future. However, if you'd like, you can add on to this too and add your own features or tweaks. If you do, I don't require any credit for this—since this is an extremely basic app—but if you'd like to give it anyway, that'd be cool :)
